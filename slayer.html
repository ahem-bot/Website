                Talking about the game there are several things you can do in the game such as fighting with zombies while moving in your GOKART and you have a very op gun through which you can Kill zombies. Talking about Graphics this game is made in UNITY 2023 so you expect a very high range of graphics but usually its features 2K resolution textures and the you can switch between the quality settings. On later updates we are focussing to improve the graphics further more within the hardware bounds. Thanks and enjoy your free game.
